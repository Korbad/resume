# Resume

Update: This resume builder is being deprecated. It was interesting and worked well, but the Linkin resume builder is sufficient and the deprecation of this project reduces data-duplication (resume data is not longer stored in multiple places). See https://www.linkedin.com for resume data and resume builds.

Resume is stored as LaTeX files and is compiled to PDF via GitHub Actions.

GitHub releases (tags) are automatically created on push to main branch. The generated PDF is attached to the created release.
