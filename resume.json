One goal of the PHENIX Experiment at RHIC is to study similar properties in a hadron-hadron collision environment in an attempt to show the degree to which universality is broken between these differing systems as well as the relative contribution of competing processes to the observed single spin asymmetries. A novel measurement method was formulated specifically for the PHENIX experiment's detector configuration. The method and results are presented here."

      "The proposed MPC-EX detector is a Si-W preshower extention to PHENIX's existing Muon Piston Calorimeter (MPC). The MPC-EX consists of eight layers of alternating W absorber and Si mini-pad sensors.  Located at large rapidities ($3.1 < |eta| < 3.8$), the MPC-EX and MPC access low-x partons in the heavy nucleus in p+A collisions which makes possible a study of gluon distributions in cold nuclear matter via direct photon and neutral pion measurements. With the addition of the MPC-EX, the neutral pion reconstruction energy range extends to energies >80 GeV, a factor of four improvement over current capabilities. Not only will the MPC-EX strengthen PHENIX's existing forward $pi^0$ measurements, but it will also allow for direct measurements of spin-dependent fragmentation in transversely polarized proton-proton collisions. In this presentation I will discuss the design of the MPC-EX detector and the potential impact on current and future measurements made at PHENIX."
